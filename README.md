![A redstone lamp receiving quasi-power](https://github.com/axialeaa/DoormatCarpetExtension/assets/116074698/89617f79-c926-4006-b061-84463dbf6555)

**Doormat** is a [Carpet][carpet] extension, focusing on simply adding features I want to have fun with, and hopefully you will too! Aside from new ways to farm non-renewable resources, this mod prides itself on its "redstone tinkering" features, allowing you to have full control over block updates and quasi-connectivity in your worlds.

Check out [the wiki][wiki] for a more in-depth overview of **Doormat**'s features!
***

### Getting Started
- Make sure you're running a Fabric instance of the game. If you're playing from the vanilla launcher, follow the [Fabric installation guide][fabric-guide]. If you're playing from a third-party launcher like [Prism][prism], you'll need to follow their own instructions which you can often find on their respective websites. For example, [here][prism-guide] is Prism's guide to downloading mods.
- If you're not using a third-party launcher with in-built mod installation, you'll need to download the latest version of **Doormat** for your game version from the [GitHub releases][github-releases] page or on [Modrinth][modrinth-versions]. Drag the `.jar` file into your mods folder and launch the game!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Doormat** needs to be installed on both the client and server sides in order to get the full experience. If you're playing on a multiplayer server, contact your server administrator to request this mod be installed. Like Carpet, it will not work on Paper, Spigot, Purpur or any other non-Fabric server softwares.

### More Extensions
There are a lot of other Carpet extensions out there, adding countless new rules and functionality! You can find a list of them in the [Carpet wiki][carpet-extensions].
