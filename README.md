Doormat is a [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) extension, focusing on simply adding features I want to have fun with, and hopefully you will too! Aside from new ways to farm mostly non-renewable resources, this mod prides itself on its "redstone tinkering" features, allowing you to have control over block updates and quasi connectivity in your worlds.
