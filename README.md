Doormat is a [Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) extension, focusing on simply adding features I want to have fun with, and hopefully you will too! Aside from new ways to farm non-renewable resources, this mod prides itself on its "redstone tinkering" features, allowing you to have full control over block updates and quasi-connectivity in your worlds.

For more information and a list of rules, please check out the [Doormat wiki](https://github.com/axialeaa/DoormatCarpetExtension/wiki). It has truly all you need to know!
***

### Getting Started
Doormat depends on Carpet being installed, and due to the use of `CommandRegistrationCallback`, you will need to download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api). Once you have, simply drag Carpet, Fabric API and Doormat into your Fabric mods folder. If you're playing on a multiplayer server, you'll need to have these 3 mods installed on both the server and client sides.

### More Extensions
There are a lot of other Carpet extensions out there, adding countless new rules and functionality! You can find a list of them in the [Carpet wiki](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/List-of-Carpet-extensions).
